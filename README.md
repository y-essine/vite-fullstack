# MEVN fullstack app backend
This is the server for the MEVN fullstack app. 

## Config
As seen in the config.js file `mongoUri: process.env.MONGO_URI,`, the database uri is access through the environment variables so in order to set it up 
use the cmd `export MONGO_URI=<your_uri>` replacing your_uri with yours...

## Running the server
Dev command: `npm run dev`
Prod command: `npm run start`
